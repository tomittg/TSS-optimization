There are several cc files for the models/algorythms.
There's a main for the python program that visually represents the graphs. As it's a python program, it has linked lib and venv directories.
For the input/output, we will be using the docs folder:
 - "experimentationData" for the output of the cc files that generates the data to construct graphs in python
 - "graphs" for the original set of graphs given by the teachers
 - "graphsPlusS" for the original set of graphs plus the minimum starting set found by the cc algorythms
 - "visualGraphsPlusS" for the html output of the python program that visually represents the graphs, coloring S differently than the rest of the graph
